# Skin Cancer Detection

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is one of my academic projects from my MSc Data Science course. The goal of this project is to detect skin cancer using Python and deep learning methods.

1. What It Does  
   1. Helps classify images of skin lesions using a trained model  
   2. Cleans and prepares the image dataset for analysis  
   3. Trains a deep learning model to predict results based on the input image  

2. Tools & Tech Used  
   1. Python  
   2. TensorFlow / Keras  
   3. NumPy & Pandas  
   4. Matplotlib for visuals  

3. How to Run It  
   1. Clone this repo to your local machine  
   2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script  
   3. Upload any skin image and see the prediction  

4. Note  
   1. This project was done purely for learning and academic purposes as part of my Master's degree  
   2. It helped me practice data preprocessing, model building, and visualization using real-world health data
